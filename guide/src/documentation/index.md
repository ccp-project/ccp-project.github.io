# Documentation

CCP currently supports writing algorithms in Rust, or (through language bindings) Python. 
We don't plan on adding new language bindings in the near future, but will gladly accept pull requests!

Whichever language you decide to use, you will also need to understand our domain-specific language
for writing datapath programs (don't worry, it's very simple!).
See the following section for the syntax and capabilities of this
language.
